# p5-pitch-detection
Takes an audio input and analyses the pitch to evaluate the user's ability to read and play along to guitar tablature using FFT transformations.

This repo is unlikely to be updated, it would be great to see if someone could polish this up and make an open source rocksmith clone (although I'm sure javascript wouldn't be the best language for that)

# Running
download sketch.js and copy that into p5.js's web editor.
click run
allow p5.js to use the microphone (this will be your guitar input)
the sketch expects your guitar to be in D standard tuning
